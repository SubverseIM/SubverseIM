# Introducing SubverseIM

SubverseIM is OUR Network, a peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted, fully anonymous and private instant messaging app for Android and iOS mobile devices. Currently in early-access, open-enrollment testing, this app places the means of communication in the palm of your hand, and your data solely under your control. 

## Who is this for?

SubverseIM is for anyone who is tired of prying eyes and the oppression of the surveillance state. Message your comrades without the need for a middle man. Even projects like Signal require a central authentication hub to encrypt your data; but not us. With the power of OpenPGP encryption, SubverseIM allows you to message anyone in a way that is both fully authentic and fully anonymous. 

## How to use?

Users of Android devices can enroll in our open testing program using [this link](/#) to help our team build bigger, better messaging experience for all. iOS users may contact us via email at: [root@subverse.network](mailto:root@subverse.network). This website hosts what is known as a "bootstrapper node" to help jumpstart direct connections between users of SubverseIM. Simply use this web address to configure your client, and you'll be all set! 

## I don't trust you, what next?

Rest assured. We know that trust is not easily earned. So, we removed the middle man there, too! All of SubverseIM's code is public domain (CC0), including the code needed to host your own bootstrapper node. Compile our app from source at your own discretion, and even host your own bootstrapper node for you and your friends! All of this free of charge, and without our knowledge or prior consent. 

## Give me The Sauce!
